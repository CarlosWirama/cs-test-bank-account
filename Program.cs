 * I came from javascript/typescript background, so my approach looks more functional oriented instead of OOP.
 * I chose this to do the assignment quickly. I do have some experience in OOP (C# and Java) long way back and
 * I'm willing to pick up again, so whatever language I'm going to use should not be a problem.

 * Thank you for understanding!
